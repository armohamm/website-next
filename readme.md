# Red Badger Website

## Getting Started

Install your dependencies with `npm install`.

To build the project run `npm run build`. This will build both the client and
server code to be run. Alternatively if you want to continuously build you can
use `npm run watch` to continuously build the project as you develop.

Run the server with `npm run start` and navigate to `localhost:8080`.

To lint your newly added work run `npm run lint`.

For tests run `npm run test`.
