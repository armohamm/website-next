This means we build software with the customer/user in mind, integrating our tech resources with our creative resources to build cutting edge applications that provide a beautiful experience for users.

We want the senior marketing manager role to be immersed in our culture, understand how our projects are developed and implemented, and therefore be able to communicate first hand to our key audiences about the power of the work we’re producing. This will help Red Badger grow further through increased sales, brand awareness and talent acquisition.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re looking for an experienced and tenacious individual to run all marketing operations, reporting directly into the CEO.

This may include the use of predictive analytics.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re also open to ideas and the approach you bring, so you will not be asked to align your work to our previous marketing efforts.
